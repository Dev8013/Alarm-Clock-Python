**Project Name:** Python Alarm Clock

**Description:**

This Python project implements a simple alarm clock using the `time`, `datetime`, and `pygame` libraries. It allows you to set an alarm time in the HH:MM:SS format, and when the current time reaches that specific point, it plays a pre-defined sound file ("my.wav" in this example) to wake you up.

**Features:**

- User input to set the alarm time
- Real-time clock display
- Audio alarm notification through a sound file

**Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x (download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
   - `pygame` library: Install using `pip install pygame` in your terminal

2. **Download and Run:**
   - Download this Python script and save it as `alarm_clock.py`.
   - Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run it using `python alarm_clock.py`.

3. **Usage:**
   - The script will prompt you to enter the alarm time in HH:MM:SS format.
   - It will display the current time continuously until it matches the set alarm time.
   - When the alarm triggers, a sound will be played from the "my.wav" file.

**Notes:**

- You'll need a sound file named "my.wav" in the same directory as the script for the alarm sound.
- This is a basic alarm clock with essential functionalities. You can extend it further to include features like snooze, multiple alarms, different sound options, and more.
